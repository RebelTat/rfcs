# RFC #24 - Add the Editor repo

## Summary
This repo allows developers to create and edit tests to be consumed by the WPT test infrastructure.

## Details
Originally, this repo was built by Microsoft to help facilitate debugging and authoring of tests for Web Platform Tests.

It's been living under the MicrosoftEdge repo up until now, but we believe the community will benefit from this tool.

By moving it to the Web-Platform-Tests repo, the people who are directly working with WPT will have access and context.

## Risks
This repo was created by an ex-Microsoft employee. Microsoft's current expertise in this repo is limited, so there is some risk regarding maintenance.
